## How to use

Saturn is a *self-hosted* bot, this means you will need to host and maintain your own instance. For that, you can instantiate at your own machine or you can use a cloud platform to do so. A great cloud platform that I personally use and recommend is [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), it's a nice cloud service which offers a great compatibility for apps like this one, and also has a free plan option.

In this step-by-step I will only cover about how you can set Saturn in your own machine. Also, notice that each topic in the next sections has a brief description in the title explaining what we're about to do. With that been said, let's move on.

### Getting started

First things first, make sure that you have `git`, `node` and `npm` installed. Then open your terminal or cmd and type the commands below.

#### Cloning this repository & Cd'ing into project's folder

```elm
git clone https://github.com/felpshn/saturn-bot.git

cd saturn-bot
```

#### Setting up everything

```elm
npm install
```

When the installation finishes, find the `.env.example` inside of the project's folder and open it with some text editor of your choice.

Now, make sure that you have your own bot token in hands â€” in case you don't know how to get it, go at the [Discord developers portal](https://discord.com/developers/) and create a new app.

After that, replace the `HELLO_WORLD` with your bot token and some prefix of your choice (e.g: !, +, .). When you're done, rename the `.env.example` to `.env`.

```bash
BOT_TOKEN=HELLO_WORLD
BOT_PREFIX=HELLO_WORLD
```

Now, as I mentioned before, this bot has a weather report function and also supports a MongoDB database linked to it. In case you wanna use these features, you will also need to set in the `.env` an [OpenWeather API token](https://openweathermap.org/api) and your [MongoDB database link](https://www.mongodb.com/).

To get these features working properly, your `.env` file should have this template below with your credentials settled in the `HELLO_WORLD`'s place.

```bash
BOT_TOKEN=HELLO_WORLD
DB_ACCESS=HELLO_WORLD
OPENWEATHER_TOKEN=HELLO_WORLD
BOT_PREFIX=HELLO_WORLD
```

Notice these are **extra** features! If you don't wanna use them, just follow the first `.env` template introduced in this step-by-step and your bot still will work normally.

#### Running
```elm
npm run dev
```

#### We're done!

That's pretty much it, thanks for using Saturn and have fun! Also, don't forget to read the **Additional Info** section for more details about this discord bot project.

## Additional Info

PRs are more than welcome, just remind to keep your code concise and clean in case you're planning to add more features to the bot.
